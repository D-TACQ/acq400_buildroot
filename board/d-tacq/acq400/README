# PyEPICS: build it twice, first time fails with error: libraries wrong arch. Fix by make again.
# PyEPICS includes linux_x86 and others, we remove them with fakeroot.sh
# trouble is, subsequent makes break it AGAIN. 
# looks like we have to do this, last step EVERY BUILD:
make python-pyepics-dirclean
make
# bails ERROR: architecture for "/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/epics/clibs/linux32/libca.so" is "Intel 80386", should be "ARM"
make
# somewhere, the linuxarm clibs get stripped and fail. we fix this in fakeroot.sh, but BEWARE, it will be brittle
